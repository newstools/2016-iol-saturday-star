Johannesburg - Bollywood movies were just part of growing up for South African actress, TV presenter and model Carishma Basday.Whenever her family had free time on their hands they would head to the cinemas or rent a Bollywood movie to watch together.&#x201C;My family loves Bollywood movies, especially my mom,&#x201D; Durban-born Basday says.So the family was overjoyed when Basday landed a role in the upcoming Bollywood movie Half Girlfriend.The 24-year-old recently finished shooting for the production that was filmed in Cape Town.The film is directed by Mohit Suri and features Bollywood stars Arjun Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor.In the movie, based on the novel by popular Indian author Chetan Bhagat, Basday plays an &#x201C;edgy rock singer&#x201D;.It&#x2019;s a small role, but she says it was very exciting that the scene included Kapoor as the male lead.&#x201C;Arjun is great, he is a really lovely guy, very focused and driven, and he really gives his all in every take.&#x201D;&#x201C;It was a great opportunity for me and such fun to do something a little different. Mohit is lovely, very encouraging to his actors.&#x201C;It was also really cool shooting in Cape Town; it&#x2019;s so diverse you can transform it into almost anywhere in the world.&#x201D;Basday says: &#x201C;There is no such thing as small&#x2019; on a Bollywood set, from the set to the crew and everything in-between; at times this can be a bit overwhelming. The lead actors are often always huge Bollywood stars, which can be a bit intimidating until you get to know them.&#x201D;Basday, voted one of the sexiest women in the world by FHM South Africa readers in 2012, and a presenter of SABC 3 lifestyle show Mela, says she had a blast shooting the movie, but hadn&apos;t been set on the billion-dollar Bollywood industry till now.
