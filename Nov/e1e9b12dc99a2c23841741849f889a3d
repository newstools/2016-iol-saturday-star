Johannesburg - What s a Friday night without some soft porn? That s what legions of Emmanuelle fans were asking this week with their passionate demands for the sexy vixen to be let loose on e.tv s late-night slot.And all this even though the erotic star has been off our screens for year.It was the hashtag #BringBackR18MoviesOnETV that trended on Twitter this week as a generation remembered how the light porn pushed teenage hormones over the edge at the start of every weekend. The channel reportedly hit record audience figures of 1.16 million viewers with the soft-porn series, before taking it off the air a few years ago.While the broadcaster has yet to comment on whether they are contemplating bringing back their late night R-Rated adult films, thousands have urged the station to consider a re-airing of the popular adult fare, the first of which came out in 1974.Some followers said they had abandoned the broadcaster since it removed their beloved R-Rated adult films from the schedule. Twitter user @JustKholii said: Ever since ya ll cancelled the shows, e.tv has not been the same. I probably watch it twice a year now; sies. Others went as far as saying that alcohol abuse would be curbed if the channel brought back their R-Rated films. #BringBackR18MoviesOnETV teenagers will stay away from alcohol and taverns, tweeted @Asey_Pot1.But a handful of Twitter users were totally against the idea. Musician Ntsiki Mazwai tweeted: U want porn on general tv are you stupid or non-thinking? Horny energy suppressing brain cells? #BringBackR18MoviesOnETV,. she tweetede.tv did not respond to a request for comment on the topic.Saturday Star
