Abandoned and orphaned children who are inadequately cared for in their first 1 000 days of life are severely compromised, writes Noni Mokati.Abandoned and orphaned children who are inadequately cared for in their first 1 000 days of life are severely compromised when it comes to their chances of adoption.Speaking at a recent adoption seminar hosted by the Department of Social Development and the National Adoption Coalition of South Africa in Boksburg, Dr Michelle Pentecost from Oxford University said: &#x201C;Early adoption at birth or in early life has long-term benefits for health and potential.&#x201D;Pentecost spoke about the right nutrition from the moment a foetus is conceived.She highlighted things such as not smoking, not drinking, not taking drugs. She also spoke about the need for love and attention and play and stimulation.&#x201C;This period is crucial. Caring for your baby should start before birth. Physical and brain development occur at a very fast rate during this time,&#x201D; she said.She said this issue of very early childhood development remains dire in South Africa as challenges like malnutrition remain a problem even in the post-apartheid era.She pointed out other obstacles for orphaned children such as not having a primary caregiver and sometimes living in unsafe or poverty-stricken environments.Pentecost spoke of the different stages of childhood development. She compared a child who receives the right care and one whose needs are neglected.She said between the ages of 3 and 5 years, there is a window of opportunity for dramatic brain development of memory, inhibitory control, cognitive and mental flexibility.She highlighted that at this age a child whose needs have been adequately considered begins pre-school with an advantage and is able to form friendships with other children and good relationships with pre-school workers.On the other hand, a child of the same age whose developmental goals have been ignored experiences problems at this stage.Children up for adoption often fall into this category and their deficiencies are more apparent. Pentecost added that these children can act out aggressively.&#x201C;When the process of finding a family begins there are difficulties in finding suitable adopters when the child is of an older age,&#x201D; she said.The right way to adoptWorld Adoption Day is on Tuesday, and Adoption Voice is hoping to raise awareness around the role of adoption in society and the correct way to do it, such as making sure you are financially and emotionally secure and properly advised before you make your decision.Adoption Voice, which is part of the National Adoption Coalition of South Africa (Nacsa), has noted that adoption levels are dropping, but the number of neglected and abandoned children is on the increase.The campaign&apos;s focus creates positive awareness for the option of adoption and works to make it accessible to all South Africans.Although adoptions have increased marginally this year, they have declined by more than 50 percent over the past decade, the organisation said.Adoption Voice added: &#x201C;Adoption is also continually associated with child trafficking by the general public, the courts and the Department of Social Development.&#x201C;During World Adoption Day, Adoption Voice will launch a new campaign to raise awareness for the right way to do adoptions.&#x201D;Fact File Up to 45 percent of children admitted to registered child/youth care centres are there because of abandonment/ neglect. Up to to 50 percent of all abortions in South Africa are conducted through unsafe channels (2013). Illegal abortions are estimated at 100 000 per year. It&#x2019;s estimated that 90 000 children live in child-headed households and have only limited access to social grants. Adoptions continue to decline, with only 1 448 adoptions taking place in 2014, a decline of more than 50 percent since 2004.Source: National Adoption Coalition of South Africa [email&#160;protected] Saturday Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
