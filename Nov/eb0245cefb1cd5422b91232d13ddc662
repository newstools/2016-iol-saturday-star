Johannesburg - Satnavs and Google had no idea, neither did a Saturday Star recce team: there is no Saxonwold shebeen to be found.The only drinking place in the vicinity of Saxonwold that could be a &#x201C;shebeen&#x201D; is about two streets away from the Gupta compound. It&#x2019;s Moyo&#x2019;s Zoo Lake and, no, Brian Molefe was not seen there.Molefe had South Africans taking to social media with memes and jokes after he caused a stir on Thursday explaining the reasons behind his visits to Saxonwold after his name cropped up in the State of Capture report compiled by the office of the public protector and released on Wednesday.In a press conference, Molefe explained that he was in Saxonwold because he was visiting a shebeen in the area, and not to visit, as suggested in the report, the now infamous, for alleged state capture, Gupta family.Twitter users had a blast with the #SaxonwoldShebeen trending for most of Thursday and part of yesterday. Here&#x2019;s some of what they had to say:Max du Preez @MaxduPreez&#x201D; &#x201C;Shaun Abrahams hears of &apos;the bar council&apos; &amp; &apos;debarred&apos; &amp; thinks: this would never happen at the bar at the #SaxonwoldShebeen.&#x201D;Random Awesomeness @randammitlycool: &#x201C;Try the #SaxonwoldShebeen new drink the load shedder&#x201D; - it&#x2019;s a shot in the dark!&#x201D; Saturday Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
