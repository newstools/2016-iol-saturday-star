Johannesburg - The hunt is on for the missing 10. Somewhere lurking on the streets are 10 Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones that should be handed back to the manufacturers. This after the devices were globally recalled last month after some exploded.There were 55 South Africans who pre-ordered the phones, but 10 people seem to be reluctant to return their devices after the model was launched overseas last month. The sleek smartphones feature coveted dual-SIM capability, iris-scanning and wireless charging.The missing phones are putting everyone near them at risk, says National Consumer Commission (NCC) spokesperson Trevor Hattingh. The global recall saw at least 2.5 million units never make it to market. The defect is said to lie with the phone&#x2019;s battery, which caused some phones to emit smoke or catch alight, it was reported.It&#x2019;s the dual-SIM feature that Hattingh said was probably the deal-sealer for the 10 people.In a meeting with NCC this week, Samsung South Africa said it had reached out to the 10 owners who were still unwavering in their resolve to hold on to their phones.Samsung has offered to exchange the devices with the Samsung S7 Edge dual-SIM range, which would have to be imported as it isn&#x2019;t available in the country.Should the owners not hand over the phones of their own accord and take up Samsung&#x2019;s offer to exchange them or accept a refund, the devices would be remotely deactivated.Samsung SA said that its voluntary exchange programme to recover all the devices was also being extended to consumers who may have acquired their devices overseas.The company has said it supports the global ban on the devices as well as the rule prohibiting them from being taken on board planes because of their potential to cause an in-flight explosion.For flying passengers, the company has also implemented an exchange programme at kiosks near the departure terminals at major airports, such as OR Tambo, Cape Town International Airport and King Shaka International.
