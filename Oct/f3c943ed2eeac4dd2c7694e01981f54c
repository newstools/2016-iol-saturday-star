Johannesburg - Marietjie Vosloo could face up to 60 years in a Mauritian prison if she is found guilty of murdering her stepdaughter on the paradise island of Mauritius.Mauritian newspaper L&#x2019;Express reported on Friday that there is a &#x201C;good chance&#x201D; the South African mother from Springs will be convicted of murder, but police are still investigating. The 34-year-old appeared in court last week and was initially charged with manslaughter for causing the death of her 17-year-old stepdaughter, Mundolene.The teenager collapsed last Wednesday after Marietjie allegedly attacked her. She was on holiday with her father, Mike Vosloo, and two brothers. Marietjie could also face a charge of manslaughter, according to her lawyer Raouf Gulbul.If she is found guilty and convicted, Marietjie will have to serve her sentence in Mauritius.
