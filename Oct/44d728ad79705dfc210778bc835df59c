Johannesburg - The Treasury has told the Gupta family to stop its media campaign against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan following a week of sustained responses in the media to his affidavit detailing their transactions totalling R6.8 billion.The Guptas this week responded through media statements that the Treasury&apos;s claims contain contradictions.This follows a turbulent week for the controversial family&apos;s Oakbay Investments in which Minister Pravin Gordhan&#x2019;s revelations about transactions flagged as suspicious by the Financial Intelligence Centre were followed by the resignation of company chief executive Nazeem Howa.The company&apos;s lawyers were expected to file their responding affidavit to Gordhan&#x2019;s application for a declaratory order that he&apos;s not legally obliged to intervene in their disputes with the major banks.Gordhan&#x2019;s court battle with Oakbay over his application comes ahead of a showdown in court with the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA).This has also caused ructions in the ANC, with the ANC in North West on Friday urging him &#x201C;not to behave in a manner that casts aspersion on law enforcement agencies&#x201D;.The ANC in North West, under the leadership of provincial chairman and premier Supra Mahumapelo, has been critical of Gordhan and known to be staunch supporters of President Jacob Zuma.According to provincial secretary Dakota Legoete, none of the province&#x2019;s structures will participate in activities to support Gordhan when he appears in court on November 2.&#x201C;We will only do so if there is a decision of the collective of the NEC (national executive committee) in this regard,&#x201D; said Legoete.
