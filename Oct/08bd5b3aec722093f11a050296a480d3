Johannesburg - The Durban boy caught on tape violently attacking and verbally abusing a fellow schoolmate this week now faces assault charges. The video of his brutal outburst caused a social media storm.In the video, the teenager approaches a classmate outside the school. The bully is at least a head taller than the victim. With a single push he has the boy on ground and is shouting at him, threatening &#x201C;to put him in hospital next time&#x201D; and swearing at the boy, whom he accuses of snitching on him.This while the victim pleads with him to stop and &#x201C;to leave me alone for once in his life&#x201D;. A girl&#x2019;s voice is heard, saying with a laugh &#x201C;He&#x2019;s crying&#x201D;, referring to the victim.The incident took place outside a school in Hillary, Durban. It&#x2019;s one of two incidents of bullying and cyber-bullying that reared their ugly head s again this week.In another incident that showed up on Facebook, a 16-year-old Cape Town girl recorded an intimidating Whatsapp video of a 14-year-old girl from Groote Schuur. In the video she swears and curses. She says: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m beautiful and you&#x2019;re not.&#x201D; And she warns her target to &#x201C;make sure police escort you to school or I&#x2019;ll escort you to the grave&#x201D;.Both incidents had social media outraged and people wanting to stand up for the victims.On Facebook, the sister of the Hillary victim wrote: &#x201C;This is my brother (victim)... he was beaten because he snitched&#x2019; on this other child for bringing a knife to school! I am absolutely horrified!&#x201D;Speaking to the Saturday Star on Friday, the sister, who is not being named, said her brother, who is 16, is &#x201C;shaken up&#x201D; but has &#x201C;no visible wounds&#x201D;.&#x201C;He wants this all to be over. He wants the bully out of his school. He loves his school and wants to go back, but he wants to be safe. He&#x2019;s not angry or p***** off, just disappointed that it had to go this far for things to be done.&#x201D;In a statement, the school&#x2019;s governing body on Friday said it had begun internal disciplinary processes, adding that the offender had been temporarily suspended.Responding to Groote Schuur incident, some on Facebook wrote: &#x201C;Young people need to realise that there are consequences for their actions. We as parents, grandparents, aunties, uncles will not tolerate this crap!&#x201D;Parents are not taking the bullying lying down, with some employing bodyguards for their children and other laying assault charges against the bullies, because there are currently no laws prohibiting cyber-bullying.Lawyer Diana Schwarz of PPM Attorneys said the Protection From Harassment Act made provision for minors who were intimidated by other minors to lay charges against them.The act, of 2011, states that a victim of bullying may ask the court for an interim protection order.&#x201C;Children under the age of 18 can lay charges of bullying or harassment against a bully. Children from the ages of 10 to 18 are deemed to be legally liable for their actions and can be sued for defamation civilly,&#x201D; Schwarz said.Professor Ann Skelton of the Centre for Child Law at the University of Pretoria emphasised that cases can be handled under the Protection from Harassment Act.&#x201C;If the cyber-bullying involves any sexual offences, for instance, sending revealing photos to other parties, these are classified as crimes under the Criminal Law which involves sexual offences and related matters,&#x201D; she said.Bullying is taking its toll on young people, though the SA Anxiety and Depression Group (Sadag) operations manager Tracy Feinstein said the organisation did not have a direct number for suicide cases related to bullying.&#x201C;What we can confidently say is that teen suicide is on the rise. We are also aware that the age is rapidly dropping.&#x201D; Saturday Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
